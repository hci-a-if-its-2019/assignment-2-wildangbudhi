# Sketching and Prototyping

## Part A: Sketches
Problem :
- User did'nt aware Adzan Feature

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches
```
Be sure to label the different versions so you can differentiate them in your discussion. 
If you choose to take a picture of your sketches, please make sure the texts are readable.
```

![Version1](/photos/1.jpg)
![Version2](/photos/2.jpg)
![Version3](/photos/3.jpg)


### 2. Version Differences
```
Solution 1 :
Add ADZAN Icon to set Adzan bellow all icon

Solution 2 :
Remove Audio Manager Icon and replace it with ADZAN Icon because Audio Manager should be in setting page

Solution 3 :
Remove Penilaian Icon because it's useless only for rating this app in Play Store and replace it with ADZAN Icon.
```

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
For that problem I prefer the third version. Because it's easier to found Adzan Icon because the position is not to low and not to high
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
In assignment-1 , I have interview with a user to test this App.
She didn't aware that there is Adzan Reminder Feature, Because the button is not visible.
For the rationale of my design, i have added a bigger icon and a proporstional position for Adzan Reminder Feature to this app
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
Since this is only Android App this App not able to run in other Platrform so, at least 4 inch Android Phone
```
### 2. Users
```
Every Segment of People
```
